// Williams R. Determine overbought and oversold.

// Developed by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is
// the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. Also referred to as %R,
// Williams %R reflects the level of the close relative to the highest high
// for the look-back period. In contrast, the Stochastic Oscillator reflects
// the level of the close relative to the lowest low. %R corrects for the
// inversion by multiplying the raw value by -100. As a result, the Fast
// Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R produce the exact same lines, but
// with different scaling. Williams %R oscillates from 0 to -100; readings
// from 0 to -20 are considered overbought, while readings from -80 to -100
// are considered oversold. Unsurprisingly, signals derived from the Stochastic
// Oscillator are also applicable to Williams %R.

// WR = (Highest High - Closing) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) * -100.
//
// Buy when -80 and below. Sell when -20 and above.
