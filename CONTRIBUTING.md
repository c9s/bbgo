# Contributing

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! :sparkles:. 

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/c9s/bbgo/issues) to find one that interests you.
You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone.
If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Making Changes

Install pre-commit to check your changes before you commit:

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    pre-commit run markdownlint --files=README.md --verbose
    pre-commit run detect-secrets --all-files --verbose

See <https://pre-commit.com/> for more details.

For new large features, such as integrating binance futures contracts, please propose a discussion first before you start working on it.

For new small features, you could open a pull request directly.

For each contributor, you have chance to receive the BBG token through the polygon network.

Each issue has its BBG label, by completing the issue with a pull request, you can get correspond amount of BBG.
