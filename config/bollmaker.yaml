    #     # Scale spread base on weighted Bollinger band width ratio between default and neutral bands.
    #     # Given the default band: moving average bd_mid, band from bd_lower to bd_upper.
    #     # And the neutral band: from bn_lower to bn_upper
    #     # Set the sigmoid weighting function:
    #     #   - to ask spread, the weighting density function d_weight(x) is sigmoid((x - bd_mid) / (bd_upper - bd_lower))
    #     #   - to bid spread, the weighting density function d_weight(x) is sigmoid((bd_mid - x) / (bd_upper - bd_lower))
    #     # Then calculate the weighted band width ratio by taking integral of d_weight(x) from bx_lower to bx_upper:
    #     #   - weighted_ratio = integral(d_weight from bn_lower to bn_upper) / integral(d_weight from bd_lower to bd_upper)
    #     #   - The wider neutral band get greater ratio
    #     #   - To ask spread, the higher neutral band get greater ratio
    #     #   - To bid spread, the lower neutral band get greater ratio
    #     # The weighted ratio always positive, and may be greater than 1 if neutral band is wider than default band.
    #
    #     # Sensitivity factor of the weighting function: 1 / (1 + exp(-(x - bd_mid) * sensitivity / (bd_upper - bd_lower)))
