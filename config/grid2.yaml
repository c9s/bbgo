    ## compound is used for buying more inventory when the profit is made by the filled SELL order.
    ## when compound is disabled, fixed quantity is used for each grid order.
    ## default: false
    compound: true

    ## earnBase is used to profit base quantity instead of quote quantity.
    ## meaning that earn BTC instead of USDT when trading in the BTCUSDT pair.
    # earnBase: true

    ## profitSpread is the profit spread of the arbitrage order (sell order)
    ## greater the profitSpread, greater the profit you make when the sell order is filled.
    ## you can set this instead of the default grid profit spread.
    ## by default, profitSpread = (upperPrice - lowerPrice) / gridNumber
    ## that is, greater the gridNumber, lesser the profit of each grid.
    # profitSpread: 1000.0

    ## There are 3 kinds of setup
    ## NOTICE: you can only choose one, uncomment the config to enable it
    ##
    ## 1) fixed amount: amount is the quote unit (e.g. USDT in BTCUSDT)
    # amount: 10.0

    ## 2) fixed quantity: it will use your balance to place orders with the fixed quantity. e.g. 0.001 BTC
    # quantity: 0.001

    ## 3) quoteInvestment and baseInvestment: when using quoteInvestment, the strategy will automatically calculate your best quantity for the whole grid.
    ##    quoteInvestment is required, and baseInvestment is optional (could be zero)
    ##    if you have existing BTC position and want to reuse it you can set the baseInvestment.
    quoteInvestment: 10_000
    baseInvestment: 1.0
